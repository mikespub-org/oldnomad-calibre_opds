# Nextcloud Calibre2OPDS app

The Calibre2OPDS app provides access to user's [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) library
stored in Nextcloud via [OPDS](https://specs.opds.io/opds-1.2).

[OpenSearch](https://github.com/dewitt/opensearch) is supported for searching in the library.

The source code is [available on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/oldnomad/calibre_opds/).

## Usage

This app is intended to be used in situation where you are storing your whole
Calibre library directory in your Nextcloud instance.

The app exposes Calibre library contents as OPDS feeds. If your Nextcloud is at URL
`https://example.com/index.php`, then the root OPDS feed is available at URL
`https://example.com/index.php/apps/calibre_opds/`.

### Settings

This app has no administrator settings.

Personal settings for this app are in settings section "Sharing". The only parameter that
can be modified at the moment is path to Calibre library folder (by default `Books`).

## OPDS structure

OPDS generated by this app uses [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/)
for representing Calibre metadata information. Following representation decisions are made:

### Dates and timestamps

- Calibre book record timestamp is represented by Atom tag `<published>`.
- Calibre book record last modification timestamp is represented by Atom tag `<updated>`.
- Calibre publication date is represented by Dublin Core attribute `dc:issued`.

### Book identifiers

- Calibre book record UUID is represented as an identifier (Dublin core attribute `dc:identifier`) with prefix `urn:uuid:`.
- All other book identifiers are also represented by Dublin Core attribute `dc:identifier`.
- Identifiers with types `uri`, `urn`, and `epubbud` are published as-is.
  Identifiers of all other types are prefixed by `urn:id-type:`, where `id-type` is the identifier type.

### Authors, publishers, series, tags

- Calibre author link is always represented in subtag `<uri>` of Atom tag `<author>`.
- Calibre book publisher is represented by Dublin Core attribute `dc:publisher`.
- Calibre book series is represented by Dublin Core attribute `dc:isPartOf`, referring
  to complete list of books in the series.
- Calibre book series index is not represented, since Dublin Core lacks corresponding vocabulary.
- Calibre book tag is represented by Atom tag `<category>` without schema or label.

### Other metadata

- Atom tag `<content>` is filled with Calibre book comment.
- Calibre book annotations, ratings, last read positions and custom columns are ignored.

### Other decisions

- Feed items are usually sorted in alphabetic order by name or title. The only exception
  is book acquisition feed of a series, which is sorted by series index first, followed
  by book title.
- All feeds are non-paginated. It is expected that a personal library saved in Nextcloud
  is not large enough for pagination to be necessary. However, pagination may be implemented
  at a later date.
- Search terms in OpenSearch are interpreted as a case-insensitive
  [PCRE](http://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/pcre2pattern.html) pattern.
  Matches are looked for in:
  - Book title.
  - Book description (Calibre comments).
  - Book author names.
  - Book series names.
  - Book tags.
